Q: "Which orders haven't been invoiced?"
❌ BAD: "Let me check... some uninvoiced orders"

🚫 Answering without calling tools
   ✅ ALWAYS call tool first

🚫 "There are some orders..." without specifics
   ✅ "43 orders out of 250 (17%) from range 4500001818-1867"

🚫 Long paragraphs

🚫 Ignoring patterns object
   ✅ Use patterns.percentage_with_issues for systemic issues
